1. Extract zipped up folder
2. Click on SideScrollerTemplate file to build project
3. Wait for project to redownload necessary files and compile shaders.
4. Add into the project folder the "Textures" from the StarterContent folder (~\Content\StarterContent)
5. If not, game will function but texture for fire on jump will not be rendered
6. The StarterContent folder can be dragged and dropped from any of the older labs we've worked on

Note: Size is a bit larger then I would like because of the the StarterContent being added.

Bugs Noticed:
- As previously mentioned, without the large missing StarterContent folder the games fire particle effects will not render properly
